# Analyzing international debt stats

In this project, we'll investigate international debt data collected by The World Bank, a global organization that funds countries to manage their economies. We're going to reveal some interesting facts and figures, including:

- The number of countries with debt
- The total amount of debt owed by all the countries
- The country with the highest debt and the amount of its debt
- The average amount of debt owed by countries across different debt indicators
- The most common debt indicator
